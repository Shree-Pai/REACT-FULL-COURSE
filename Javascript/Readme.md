**Javascript**


ES6
let and const
callback
destructuring of function
default
Arrow function 

Javascript is  a dyanamic scripting language
Its both server and client side scripting language

Variables:
    Its is container to store value to perform operations for future use.
    Creating variable using 3 keywords
    - var(older approach ,global scope, redeclare the variable, can re-intialise multiple times)
    - let(block or functional level scope, cannot redeclare the variable)
    - const(cannot re-initialise)
    - let and const Introduced in ES6

Datatypes:
    It adds the label to the container.
    -> Primitive datatype -> number,string,boolean,undefined(variable is declared but not initialised),null(variable with no value),BigInt(to store beyond normal number),Symbol.
    ->Reference datatype -> Array, Object, Function

->Javascript is loosely typed(dont need to define the type of datatype)

->for loop(know the number of iterations)
->while loop
->do-while loop

->Break
->Continue(skip the particular iteration)

->Array
Array is the collection of data (need not be similar datatype in js)

->Function
A group of code grouped together to perform a specific task according to requirements is called function. Can achieve code reusability.

Default Parameter is used when no argument is used

Nested function - FUnction inside another function

Objects:
It is a data structure in javascript
It is collection of keyvalue pairs where is the information or data is stored in the form of Keys and Value


Destructuring of Object
