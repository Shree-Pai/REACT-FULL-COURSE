    Creating variable using 3 keywords
    - var(older approach ,global scope, redeclare the variable, can re-intialise multiple times)
    - let(block or functional level scope, cannot redeclare the variable)
    - const(cannot re-initialise)
    - let and const Introduced in ES6

Datatypes:
    It adds he label to the container.
    -> Primitive datatype -> number,string,boolean,undefined(variable is declared but not initialised),null(variable with no value),BigInt(to store beyond normal number),Symbol.
